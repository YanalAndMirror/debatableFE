## `components` folder

Consider restructuring the components folder into a modules structure where each subfolder contains a tree of related components.
e.g.

```
|- components/
    |- Body/
        |- CardList/
            |- CardItem.js
            |- index.js
        |- index.js
```

This could make it easier to organize and find components once the tree grows too large.

## General comments

You're working on too many things at the same time.
There are multiple half finished `pages` and `components`.
This lack of discipline could waste a lot of your precious time as things get more complex.
It also wastes a lot of your future teammate's time because reviewers expect finished code.

Also, in a real life scenario, deployment would be automated from the `main` branch so EVERYTHING in this branch should be ready for users. If you really want a playground, you can have a `dev` or `staging` branch that your merge into `main` on a regular basis.
